In my Object-Oriented Programming lab (course code 112), I learned how to use C++ to write computer programs. It was all about organizing code in a smart way to make it easier to understand and work with. We focused on building blocks called "classes" that help organize data and actions together. We also learned how to inherit characteristics from one class to another, like how a cat inherits traits from its parent class, "animal." We practiced solving problems by breaking them down into smaller, manageable pieces. By the end of the lab, I felt confident in my ability to write clean, efficient code and solve programming puzzles. It was a great introduction to the world of computer science! It was a fun and rewarding experience!
